<h2>Using CADRE Academy</h2>
<div class="container">

  <p>The two core parts of the CADRE Academy system are workshops and tracks,
    represented throughout the system by panels in two different styles. Workshop panels
    are smaller and represent any individual workshop that you can take through the CADRE
    Academy system. Track panels are larger and represent a set of workshops in a logical
    group or curriculum.</p>

  <h3>Workshops</h3>
  <p>Workshop panels provide the name of the workshop, the professor teaching it, the next
    available session of the workshop, and the workshop designation. An icon is added to
    the workshop panel to indicate which workshops you have registered for and which
    workshops you have completed.</p>

      <div class="title">Workshop you have completed</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Tracks</h3>
  <p>Tracks use a similar set of marks to help you determine your progress through the track.
  The overall layout of the track indicates the workshops you should take, and in what
  order (where applicable), while the individual marks let you know which workshops you
    have already registered for or completed.</p>
